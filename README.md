 Seattle University Computer Science Course Planner

This project was inspired by Seattle University’s **Course Schedule by Major** from the Albers School of Business. While that tool is great for business students, there wasn’t an equivalent resource for **Computer Science** majors in the College of Science and Engineering. The goal of this project is to make course planning easier for SU CS students by showing when courses are offered and what prerequisites they require.

Purpose
The planner helps students:
- Plan ahead and choose courses for each quarter.
- Understand which **prerequisites** are needed before taking advanced classes.
- View courses organized by **1000-, 2000-, 3000-, 4000-, and 5000-levels**.
- Track progress toward graduation more efficiently.

---

Features
- Lists when each course is typically offered (Fall, Winter, Spring, Summer).
- Highlights prerequisite chains between courses.
- Organizes classes by level for clear academic progression.
- Designed for **Seattle University CS majors** to plan the next school year or entire degree path.

---

Future Goals
- Add interactive filters to search by prerequisites or completed courses.
- Integrate credit tracking and progress visualization.
- Sync with real-time course availability data from SeattleU’s catalog.
- Create a web-friendly version accessible via GitHub Pages.

 Inspiration
This project takes inspiration from the Albers “Course Schedule by Major,” but is built for CS students who often need to plan around strict prerequisites and limited offerings each quarter. It aims to simplify academic planning, save time, and reduce stress for current and future SU students.
